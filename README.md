# Current state of the project

## gui.py
This is barebones and needs a lot of thought for what this needs and how to arrange it

## OverTheAir_Testing
This is not needed any more. And probably now irrelevent because of the change to using a Python library for file transfer

## pack.py
This is good. Maybe just more testing

## ssh_key.py
Probably irrelevent due to same point as before

## test.py
Contains tests written by the ai. Seems useful. Perhaps we can use test driven development?

## upload_rsync.py 
This is the old upload file. It uses Rsync and commandline for everything. Irrelevent

## upload.py
Uses the new python module to do the uploading. Needs to be tested to see if known_hosts causes any effects
